 Tunes collected in the Isle of Man in ABC format
Original transcription from the manuscripts of Dr John Clague et.al. from the Manx Museum were published by the late Colin Jerry in 1987. Late editions included an index of the tunes compiled by Ian Radcliffe.  Tony Hopson started converting the files to ABC format, and I completed the work following his death.
The complete ABC file is called KiaullVannin160921.abc and an index of titles is provided in pdf format.
